# Lesson 0x0 : Hello World

[The Hello World project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

You’ll learn how to:

*   Create and use a repository
*   Start and manage a new branch
*   Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
*   Open and merge a pull request

But before doing that, let's first learn more about Github and Git and how they are marking the world a better place.


## x01 : What is Git ? 

Git is a free, open-source version control software. This basically means that it is a content tracker.

Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So they need a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) like Git to make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.

So a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) allows developers to revert and go back to an older version, check modifications, follow them and keep the whole work organised between a full team of coworkers or "Code-friends".

And to do that, they use [The Branching System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(version_control)) in Git that allows developers to work individually on a task (For example: One branch -> One task OR One branch -> One developer). Basically think of Git as a small software application that controls your code base, if you’re a developer.


## x02 : What are Git repositories ?

A repository (or “Repo” for short) is a project that contains multiple files. In our case a repository will contain code-based files.

So, if we want to start using Git and its amazing "Branching and Version Controlling" Systems, we need to know where to host our repositories.

There are two ways you can host your repositories. One is online (on the cloud) and the second is offline (self-installed on your server).

And here we can jump to our [x03](README.md#x03) and talk about Github.

# Questions asked by Github :

* Describe the existing technical student communities on your campus. Who is served? Where are there gaps?
* Choose one GitHub Education program. How could it support your on-campus student communities?
* What would you need to do in order to support the growth of student tech communities on campus?

**1. Describe the existing technical student communities on your campus. Who is served? Where are there gaps?**

> Our project is to teach, help learn and improve students new skills on the Computer Science field.
> For that we are creating an Open Source Community (dzCode ) that knows how to contribute, use Open Source projects and even benefits from the them. 
> But before doing that people have to learn how to use and be comfortable with Git and Github, that's why I'm applying for this so I can teach them and help them understand and "mindset" of the Open Source.
> So for me it's not only about a **campus**, but a whole **country** ( Algeria ) were we don't have a lot of Open Source users and contributors, So why not starting by teaching them the utility of it and how Open Source is leading the future.

**2. Choose one GitHub Education program. How could it support your on-campus student communities?**
Certainly the Github Education Pack.

> As new learners, the Github Education Pack is just the perfect choice with what it provides as tools and offers what new students will need, especially for a country like Algeria where they can't really offer what can Github give them with this pack.

**3. What would you need to do in order to support the growth of student tech communities on campus?**

> We are by building a community, for the moment we are trying to collect resources and materials to start teaching them how Open Source works, then building projects together where everyone can help build and improve.
> So we are so hyped for this to help grow a big tech community that loves and uses Open Source projects as solutions.
